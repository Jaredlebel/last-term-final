                <p>When November is approaching, you may look in the mirror pondering what style of lip sweater would best suit you for the Movember season. Perhaps you are thinking of sporting a wonderful handlebar, maybe a pencil stache or on the other end of the spectrum, the walrus. Let’s look into the history, faces and learn more about Movember to gather insight.</p>

                <h2>First Documented Stache</h2>
                <p>A Pazyrik painting of a horseman with upper lip hair dated around 300 BC was found and is known to be the first documneted moustache ever. This guy clearly was the manliest man of his time and was pioneering a new breed of Sirs indeed. Who’s to say if there were men adorning lip caps before this time but it’s safe to say on paper that this man did it first.</p>

                <h2>Mo 7th Centruy - 16th Century</h2>
                <p>Beards were the fashion of the time and men would part them in the middle due to what I assume is limited access to shaving supplies. This would definitely be a time which we could refer to men’s facial hair as “the flavour saver”. In 1070 William I passed a law stating that all men had to cut off their beards for fashion. Hygeine could have been the real strategy here. Lets just say it’s possible that the rate of kisses per capita probably had a positive result.</p>

                <p>A painting of Henry VIII of England sporting a moustahce and beard is known the be the ctalyst settign the beard and stache combination of the time.</p>

                <h2>Comb that Mo!</h2>
                <p>In the 1600's Sir Anthony Vandyke was the next flavour saver pioneer. He introduced the brush into his daily moustashe routine and it soon caught on. Men all around began to groom their furry lips in order to apease the hygeine gods, not to mention look like a sir in the process. A new generation of mos were on there way with a new generation of men following along.</p>

                  <h2>Less Is More</h2>
                <p>By the 1800's the moustache kind of took a back seat to side burns and beards. Most men dropped their stache for the popular mutton chops, beards and other side burn styles. Although in Austria men were styling their long whiskers away. It wasnt until the 1900s until we see a nose bug revival. Not only did the stache come back but it came with a vengeance.</p>

                <h2>Coo Coo Ca Chu</h2>
                <p>As the 1900's came along men began to embrace the clean shaven face. With these smooth baby faced gentleman came also a bushy upper lip walrus moustashe. As the wars came around though it was more common for men to shave. A walrus rolling around the trenches and mud did not make for a very appealing upper lip. It just made sense to get rid of it altogether and hope for a better day. There were men still adorning upper lip hair throughout the 1900's but as the nineties approached it began to loose popularity. There were still men such as police, military and firemen and also a rising poplularity amongst the gay community. Maybe we can put the blame on the clean shaven yuppie but who knows exactly what killed the stache generation of the time.</p>

                <h2>The New Mollenium</h2>
                <p>In 1999 some men in Australia coined the term Movemeber implanting a new idea of the mo. They started a campaign to rasie money for the ASPCA and it soon took off and quickly gained popularity. Wow! Finally the moustache is cool again! The years leading up to today have proved that upper lip hair is getting ever so popular. Every year we can see Walruses, English and Coniseur mos all over mens faces and even more so during the Movember season. In 2010 Ram Singh Chauhan (India) snatched the world record for longest stash and locked himself into manliest man ever until proven otherwise. It measure a massive 14’. Now we see a rise in moustaches with what can be refered to as the hipster. Men adorn all styles of cookie dusters, women and men wear patches, tee shirts and pins with iconic moustaches and people tattoo iconic staches on their fingers for quick use. We really do live a new moustashe age.</p>
