			<h1>Famous Mos</h1>
				<p>Over the many years that the moustache has existed there have been a number of iconic staches. Some of these individuals are the even responsible for the names given to some of the whisker styles we see still to this day. Let's explore a few of these people who gave so much more than just hair above their lip.</p>

				<h2>Salvador Dali</h2>
				<p>Born in Figueres Spain in 1904, Salvador Dali was a prominent Spanish Surrealist painter and artist. He is best know for his bizarre imagery and amazing artistry heavily influenced by the Renaisance masters that preceeded him. Working with many artists along the way, Dali’s repertoire is vast including film, photography, sculpture and painting.  Although there can be many meanings behind the moustache, considering how deep Dali can be, his moustache is said to be “a simple hungariane mousatche” but let’s just say that maybe it has something to do with his facination with rhinos horns?</p>

				<h2>Fu Manchu</h2>
				<p>Dr. Fu Manchu is a fictional character introduced in a series of novels by British author Sax Rohmer. He was also featured in films, comics, television and comic books since his creation and has become an icon of evil doing and a stereo type for the evil genious. Although in the original books there is no reference to facial hair, the addition in the films and television appearances lent the name to the moustache style.</p>

Her work is celebrated in Mexico and by feminists for it’s depiction of the woman in it’s purist, uncomprimised form.

				<img src="images/john.svg" alt="An illustration of John Waters">
				<h2>John Waters</h2>
				<p>John Waters, is an American director, screenwriter, actor, stand-up comedian, journalist, visual artist, and art collector, who rose to fame in the 70's for his transgressive cult films. He referred to his cast as the Dreamlanders which were often real life criminals and unkown actors. His real claim to fame is his commercial movie called Hairspray which was adapted as a broadway musical and later adapted and remade as a musical movie with quite some success. You can tell Waters apart by his clean cut clothes and thin pencil stash above his upper lip. Really a man of class.</p>

				<img src="images/einstein.svg" alt="An illustration of Albert Einstein">
				<h2>Einstein</h2>
				<p>Einstein was a German born theoretical physics best know for “E=MC2”. His theory of relatively sky rocketed him into fame and revolutionized the way we saw physics at the time. Among this accomplishment he also won a Nobel Prize and contributed so much more to physics and science throughout his life. Along with this came a wild head of hair and an equally wild Walrus moustache. This, I can only assume to be an extension of the wild thoughts that must have raced through his brain to come up with all these innovative ideas.</p>

				<img src="images/hogan.svg" alt="An illustration of Hulk Hogan">
				<h2>Hulk Hogan</h2>

He gained popularity in the 80's from his stage persona Hulk Hogan and enjoyed fame through the 90's fighting in the WWF (World Wrestling Federation now the WWE). You can tell it’s him by not only the skull cap bandana on his head but also by the bushy horse shoe moustache that surrounds his lip and chin. He may be a friendly family man now but I still wouldnt want to challenge him to a fight in the ring.</p>

Ron Burgandy is the main character in the movie Anchorman: the Legend of Ron Burgundy aptly named for the main characters amazing manly attitude. Although at the time he may be a bit shy of a high IQ, he hides behind a strong and confident moustache.
